A project by University of Oslo



=== /prototype/ ===

```generate/profile/[profile_name]?
    tag     =   [tag_quantity]&
    wish    =   [wish_quantity]&
    student =   [student_quantity]
```

profile_name = name of the profile that is about to be generated

The next three GET-parameters are unordered, and are ought to be set to a value
corresponding with the desired quantity of objects.

Ignoring one of these values will force the script to assume that there is
an existing file in the profile directory that has the necessary data that
may be used in the generation of the dependant objects.

generate/profile/TestProfile?tag=10&wish=50&student=100
- will generate 10 tags, 50 wishes and 100 students.


generate/profile/TestProfile?wish=100
- will extend the wish set to 100 Wish-objects reusing the previously generated
tag and student-files
